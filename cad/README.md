All CAD  files made with TurboCAD. Due to a performance issue with TurboCAD, the working sources with geometric parts are stored in [intermediate](https://github.com/jochenalt/Walter/blob/master/cad/intermediate). The final objects (ACIS objects only) are stored here. In [simplified](https://github.com/jochenalt/Walter/blob/master/cad/simplified) the objects used within Walters UI (displayed in OpenGL) are located. The omit many details in order to speed up the UI.
